Professor!

This is your entry point for the project.

There are files
./adder.asm
../stack.asm
../shared/assembler/complex.asm
../shared/assembler/add_data.asm
../shared/assembler/add_text.asm

for you you try out.

You can read more about the ISA, assembler grammar, etc inside of
./DOC.pdf

as well as explore in
../shared/assembler
../shared/vm/

Of course nothing is off limits to explore, these are just the most functional
areas of the project thus far.
